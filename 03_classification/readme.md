# Classification ðŸ“‰ðŸ¤‘

Unlike **regression**, where you **predict a continuous number**, you use ***classification*** to **predict a category**.

- There is a wide variety of classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.

In this part, we will learn how to implement the following Machine Learning Classification models:


1. [Logistic Regression](./01_logistic_regression/)
2. [K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)](./02_k-nearest_neighbors/)
3. [Support Vector Machine (SVM)](./03_support_vector_machine/)
4. Kernel SVM
5. Naive Bayes
6. Decision Tree Classification
7. Random Forest Classification
